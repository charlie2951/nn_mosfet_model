# NN_MOSFET_Model
This repository is about the development of a compact model of Advanced MOSFET using Neural network</br></br>
**Description of Directories**</br></br>
***Planar_InGaAS:*** This directory contains model training and evaluation of a Planar InGaAs Quantum well FET. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and test the model.</br>
The dataset is prepared by running several Id-Vgs simulations using a device simulator (TCAD) for different gate and drain bias voltages, for different gate oxide thickness and channel length.</br></br>
***Gate Capacitance_InGaAs*** This directory contains the source code of the Modeling of the gate capacitance of III-V double gate MOSFET.
